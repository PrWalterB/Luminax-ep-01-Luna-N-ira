Some of the sprites were also made by a man name "This Damn Victor" but I unfortunately lost him.
If you ever find him, please contact me. He makes background sprites (like grass, or Oosphiros ground, but also
Veget's house, Progfer's, and the annoying four-legged robot wich launches many rockets. By the way, he owes me
a sprite for Champmush city hall. The other sprites were made by me (Pr.Walter Bulbazor), if I didn't forgot 
anyone, except for the explosions that I got on a website.

SOUND EFFECTS:

Once again, many by This Damn Victor, the rest by me.

English: Brumen

SPECIAL THANKS

Big thanks to Brumen who endured many beta-tests, again and again, but also thanks to anyone who
ever supported me in this veeeeeery long adventure. (please note that I lost my ancient Discord
account, don't try to contact me on it). Thanks to le Vide, to some of the Golden Team, to my pals in UCA,
and in Clermont-Ferrand in general. Thanks also to Waterflame and Chris Allen for their goodwill.
Obviously, thanks to Tnhar and Squel.

I also want to thank wholeheartedly the laws of copyright induced by the capitalist system, and the catastrophic
remuneration of artists in the society to hinder artistic creation. By the way, if someone could do a
rights-free adaptation of Mad World (without the lyrics, from the Marius Furche edit),
I would be forever grateful, it was the music I wanted for the bad ending.

I hope I'll be able to make Luminax free and put it under GNU GPLv3 licence. Until then, I need money
to live. But well, I hope one day I could live by donation and selling physic merch,
not immaterial game copies. So, a great thanks to everyone who will donate, who will buy merch,
but also to everyone who has bought the game even if it is only bits that can be easily duplicated.
I will never blame the ones who download it for free (except if you make money out of it, by any mean, then you're a jerk),
even less if you've got low financial resources. 
To make it short, I hope to live off this game, and off this others I'll make (it's not "episode 1" for nothing ;^))
