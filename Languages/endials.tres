0|Yesterday you were reading a paper for your studies about Sigma energy with your 2Squares interface© :|0|10
0|"Sigma energy is produced by most of pluricellular organisms via sigmoid cells. Used by other more specific cells,it is able to affect the environment.|0|11
0|This is how we, Luminaxians, are capable of controlling the elements around us.|0|11
0|When an organism dies, sigmoid cells go into apoptosis and massively release all their Sigma energy at one go, causing the corpse disintegration, only leaving concentrated and absorbable energy."|0|11

0|Heeeey!\nYou're finally here, Veget !!!|1.5|102
0|Hi Veget.|2|200
0|As I told you earlier, mean aliens come to invade Luminax !|1.5|100
0|Aliens, we don't know that Progfer.\nIt can be an internal threat from Luminax.|2|200
0|But who could be doing something like this ?!\nBesides, EVERY planets are more or less threatened !!!!!!|1.5|100
0|I do not know, terrorist attack ?|2|200
0|NOOO !!!!\nNO TERRORISTS !!!\nIT'S SCARY !!!!|1.5|101
0|In fact, I do not know any terrorists group with enough resources to launch an attack of this size.|2|200
0|Oooooh...Thanks Doublix !\nI feel better !|1.5|102
0|You are welcome.|2|200
0|ACTUALLY NO !\nWE'RE STILL SCREWED !!!!!\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH !!!!!!|1.5|101
0|Indeed.|2|200
0|We should go for Doobliks and Tog on Hydroplan !\nSo we go to safety with them !|1.5|102
0|Good idea.\nMoreover, Tog's military skills will be of a great help.|2|200
0|Veget, let's take your ship !\nGo now, I'm packing my things !|1.5|102
0|Let's go, yes.|2|200
1|Funny story, I forgot how much of a big fat mess you are.|0|0
0|Go to the ship, Veget, I'll join you !|1.5|102
0|...\n...\nDo you think I can bring plushes ?|1.5|100
1|I've been busy doing science|0|0
0|Yes Veget, we go to Hydroplan.\nMore precisely in the city of Oosphiros.\nYou must remember where Tog and Doobliks live, don't you?|2|200
1|It's being tons of fun so far.|0|0
0|Here we are.|2|200
0|Say, don't you think the city is quite empty ?\nIt's scary...|1.5|100
0|Indeed, but it is normal. The army evacuated everyone to the bunker under Frigiak.|2|200
0|SO IT MEANS IT'S SUPER UNSAFE TO BE HERE !!!\nAND HOW DO WE MAKE THROUGH ?\nWE'RE OUTLAWS!!!!|1.5|101
0|Not really. I called Tog earlier in the ship, she will take us with her and Doobliks in a special bunker.\nShe will not be long.|2|200
0|Aaaaah...\nPhew then ! Fortunately we're friend with Tog who is Army General !\nLet's get her !|1.5|102
0|...\nWhy are you blushing, Veget ?|1.5|100
1|Everything clean.|0|0
0|A champsur. Very decorative, it spreads its spores by sunny days though.\nBut it is a bit difficult to have sunny day sunder the sea.|0|0
1|Nothing on fire|0|0
0|An ooslik. They can be of different colors !\nThis is the iconic plant of Oosphiros...\n...Well, rather iconic mushroom .|0|0

0|BUT TOG!\nWHERE IS DOOBLIKS????|1.5|101
0|Oh, he's here !\nHi Doobliks!\nWhat are you doing in a bubble ?|1.5|102
0|Greetings, Progfer, Doublix and Veget.|4|400
0|MY STUPID SISTER KINDAPPED ME !\nFREE ME !!|4|401
0|Whew...Immediately with the big ones.\nI'm trying to protect you by taking you to the bunker.|3|301
0|DON'T LISTEN TO HER!\nSHE'S UNDER THE BLACK INVADER ROBOTS' CONTROL!|4|402
0|This moron didn't want to quit his home despite the ongoing invasion...|3|301
0|So I took care of it, by the law powers conferred on me !|3|302
0|You're the big moron !\nI'm fully able of defending myself with my\nSUPER DEATH WEAPONS !|4|404
0|Your weapons ?\nThey don't even work...|3|302
0|Of course they DO, archaic and narrow-minded soldier.|4|403
0|Of course NOT, stupid neurotic scientist.|3|302
0|There is at least one very effective I know !|4|403
0|Really ?\nTalking about your laser cannon ?\nVery effective indeed, to heat a pan...|3|302
0|No, I'm talking about PSYCHOLOGIC WEAPON!|4|400

0|AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!\nWHAT WAS THAT ??!!|1.5|101
0|I'm afraid one of their invading ship finally materialized itself in this bubble...|3|304
0|Lucky we just got all the people evacuated.\nI'm going to call some backups, but actually, Oosphiros will be destroyed before they even get here...|3|304
0|This bubble only or...?|4|402
0|Who knows, I don't know their number...\nMaybe all the city bubbles...We would end up with thousands of homeless Hydroplanians.|3|301
0|...Including us...|4|402
0|Yes.|3|305
0|However, we can limit the damage.\nI know you're all doing research about Sigma energy at university. You've got a use-licence.|3|306
0|I've known you for years, I know what you're capable of, I have the firm conviction we can try something !|3|300
0|Ma'am General, are you sure Mrs President would approve ?\nWe've got the order to interfere in no circumstances...|5|503
0|By enlisting, we made the vow to protect the people of our planet and of Luminax.\nThis stands for short term as for long term.|3|304
0|But you guys ain't in the army.\nIf you want to leave, I won't mind.\nThis is a very risky plan.|3|306
0|Come back at me if you want to fight, or ask my soldier to leave.|3|300
0|I don't know...\nI'm still very scared...\nBut I don't want people not to have houses !|1.5|100
0|In any case and for security measures, we should use our Sigma fusion experiment to defend ourselves at the best Doobliks.|2|200
0|Yeah, good idea !|4|406
2|*|0|0
2|*|0|0
2|*|0|0
0|You decided to join me ?\nCool ! It's risky, I can't guarantee victory, but I trust you !|3|300
0|On my way to bring to the bunker the specimen we captured.\nSorry for being of no help here, General.|5|503
0|Don't be, we absolutely need to make some research on these robots.\nGood luck.|3|300
0|Good luck to you.|5|503
0|They landed further away, South.\nNOW IS THE TIME TO FIGHT FOR OOSPHIROS !!!|3|307

1|It feels...So strange...|0|0
0|The inhabitants were already evacuated.\nThis city must be protected so they can keep their home !|0|0
1|Not to hate you anyyyyyymoooore...|0|0

#Bunker
0|Welcome to the Bunker 03 of Frigiak, my friends.\nIt is usually restricted to the soldiers, but there is no more place in the others. Besides, you are family of Miss Tog Ÿsel.|7|508
0|Hi Anddr!\nWe successfully pushed the invaders away from Oosphiros!|3|300
0|Mmmh...\nI know.\nOlga is mad at you.|7|507
0|BUT !|3|303
0|...But I want you to know I would have done the same, if only I weren't to handle the maneuvers on Frigiak.\nCongratulations, to all of you, for your bravery.|7|509
0|Apart from Doobliks, I only know you in the words of Tog.\nLet me introduce myself, Anddr Biokanos, General of Hydroplan Army, responsible of the Bunker 03, among other things.|7|508
0|I am Progfer !\nI live in a very nice house in Stalor. Before, I was studying Sigma energy at university. But now I'm hosting web-servers. And as my auntie says...|1.5|102
0|My name is Doublix Pepain.\nI am a recently graduated scientist.|2|200
0|You know me, but this is Veget, he can't speak, he is mute.\nIn fact, we've all met at Gentilis college. I mean, except for my sister who plays "pop pop gun gun" all day long. This is thanks to me.|4|400
0|Hm...|3|304
0|I see. I suppose you study Sigma energy.\nWe use it for our weapons, but I couldn't imagine it was possible to use it with bare hands.|7|507
0|Controlling Sigma energy without technological vector, this is the subject of our research with Doobliks. As you can see, we already performed a biological fusion by this mean.|2|200
0|...and that's why I decided to start a web-hosting career.|1.5|102
0|You heard well ?|1.5|100
0|Yes, yes, Progfer.|3|306
0|I can see you're developping interesting things with that.\nThat's good, this world needs scientits. And not only the army.|7|508
0|Doobliks is the one who mostly search for lethal use.\nI don't understand his will.\nI am a devotee pacifist.|2|200
0|Well ?\n Who's making "pop pop" all day long now ?|3|302
0|I don't kill people !\nI just like to blow things up !|4|403
0|Yeah, killing is bad !|1.5|100
0|Hydroplan army, and even the Federation's have no interest in killing.\nOnly defending the people in case of attack.|7|507
0|You already killed someone, anyhow ?|1.5|100
0|...\nOne time.\nIt was my last resort.|7|510
0|We are lucky enough to live in a peaceful world, without conflicts between our people. I truely hope it will stay this way as long as possible.|7|511
0|SO WHO ARE THE BLACK ROBOTS ????!!!!|1.5|101
0|We thought of a small terrorist group. But none of the ones we know have this much resources. It is possible for the first time of Luminax history that we are facing an alien invasion.|7|507
0|...Anyway, another clue leads to Cygio.\nEvery communications with Cygians were cut.\nSome think they are behind the attack...|7|511
0|...But they've never had an army, nor any reason to attack anybody.\nBy the way, neither the Cygian expats understand the situation...|7|507
0|Well, I've bothered you enough with my long speeches. I'll let you rest while Tog looks for a city to protect and order to ignore!|7|509
2|*|0|0
2|*|0|0
2|*|0|0
0|So you're living the bunker.\nI understand.|3|306
0|I'll stay here and try to defend the city at least.\nSee you !|3|307
0|Good, follow me, we're going to Frigiak, Bunker 03.|5|503
2|*|0|0
2|*|0|0

0|Welcome to the Bunker 03 of Frigiak, dear civilians.\nIt is usually restricted to the soldiers, but there is no more place in the others. Besides, you are family of Miss Tog Ÿsel.|7|508
0|Hey Anddr, my sister stayed on Oosphiros...\nShe's trying to defend the city.|4|407
0|I know.\nThe president didn't give the order, but I admire her bravery.|7|507
0|You're all safe here.\nYou can stay until Tog returns.|7|507
0|Thank you for your hospitaly.|2|200
0|It is my duty as a soldier of Luminax.\nTo protect the people.|7|508
2|*|0|0
2|*|0|0
2|*|0|0
0|Uuuh... Go on, I think I lost the robot on the way..|5|503
1|Would you?|0|0
0|Shh ! Don't tell Tog it's me !\nI'm the soldier from earlier, I lost the robot I was supposed to bring...|5|503
0|If I keep my helmet, she won't recognize me !\nI'm relying on your silence, little Chloralyan !|5|503
1|I was saying this to Batman!|0|0
0|Enlist they said...\nEnlist...|5|512
0|I thought I would be cushy making patrols !\nMaybe neutralize some terrorists...|5|517
0|NOT FIGHTING AGAINST A ROBOT HERD !|5|513
1|oh, he was HERE the other day...|0|0
0|We really have one of the most incredible military technology in the world !|5|519
0|What is it ?\n...\nI don't know...|5|520
1|Maybe you know him he's a big deal!|0|0
0|Oh, you're Chloralyan !\nWe beat Chloralyans during the last Fake War match, not too miffed ?|5|514
1|...but I don't of him that way...|0|0
0|Army is cool !\nDoing parades every year, maches against Chloralyans, take down some terrorists sometimes...|5|515
0|Well, I guess robots-from-elsewhere's invasions happen from time to time ?|5|516
1|He's just a friend.|0|0
0|I admire Chlorozol army, they have gorgeous uniforms, they fight with swords...|5|515
0|...But according to the last transmissions, they are in bad shape...|5|516
1|Someone I trust.|0|0
0|I am positive Cygio is in on it!\nAlways with their pacifists speeches, their so-called passion for science and exploration...|5|517
0|But trust them hey...\nAND BANG ! Behind their right-thinking aspects, they attack with deceit !|5|513
0|Stupid Cygians...\nI'll tell you what, they were preparing their robots in secret for years !|5|517
1|Someone who won't...|0|0
0|Anddr is a renowned general !\nHe arrested the sect of the Belt tens of years ago !|5|519
0|You know, the famous terrorists of the Asteroids Betl who wanted to recreate an antic planet, lost a long time ago during Halkor Empire...|5|520
0|I admire Anddr a lot !|5|519
1|KILL ME!|0|0
0|Oh you're a friend of Tog?\nEverybody here says she'll succeed Anddr !\nIt's true, I mean, he was her mentor before she was promoted general herself.|5|515
0|It's true ! She bravely defended Oosphiros !\nAnddr would have done the same if he were not to manage everything here !|5|519
1|IIIIII'm fiiiiine!|0|0
0|Hey...|5|517
0|The others seem in denial.\nThey don't realize the gravity of the situation...|5|512
0|They all think Olga will save Luminax !\n...\nBut let me tell you a secret...|5|517
0|IT IS NOTHING BUT A SCHEME !\nThe truth is Luminax is on the edge of collapsing...\n...|5|513
0|I AM SO STRESSED !\nBut nobody wants to believe me...|5|518
1|Just in case you think I'm not...|0|0
0|These ?\nThese are the supplies crates.|5|515
0|Why am around them ?\n...\n...|5|517
0|Well uuuh...\n...\nTo protect them against the robots !|5|518
1|I AM.|0|0
0|Do you see that Veget?|1.5|102
0|They're super old computers !\nBelieve it, the most powerful army of Luminax has things old of a hundred years!|1.5|102

0|Despite my pacifistic beliefs, I wonder in the light of recent events if we shouldn't have thought about means to protect ourselves in case of major crisis ?|2|200

0|It is very good yes, very praiseworthy.\nBut your chances were low, and if you had failed, it would have got them crossed !|8|1527
0|Excuse me, Madam President of Frigiak and Hydroplan, are you implying their first intentions were pacifist ?|2|200
0|Well... We don't know that !\nIn any case, an armed intervention would make the people believe we are under life-threat !|8|1527

0|The news told me not to go out...|1.5|100

0|Yes, yes, I understand your point of view.\nBut it is the duty of the president not to alarm people.|8|1530

0|I make good sulphured milk, yup.\nIt's the TRUE Dejean speciality, not like their fuel.|12|7917
0|Making sulphured milk is easy, you milk the sulphurers by pressing their trunk with a mecanohand, then you extract the sulphur from the milk so there is almost no sulphur left.|12|7817
0|Yeah kid, too much sulphur means we can't sell it to the other Luminaxians, would be toxic for them, y'know.|12|7717
0|So we exract it and there's just a delicious aftertaste. We collect the sulphur leftovers to make full-bodied sulphured milk !|12|7817
0|This, this is only for Vulavians. We're the only one who can drink it, but it makes us a bit worked up, so we don't drink too much.|12|7917

0|It's said that on the last night of the year, while a black mist covers the whole region and you can't see Luminax shining, the Moustkurinn awakes.|12|7918
0|It's a giant mousteuf, tall of several foot, vile, lashing out at the people...|12|7918
0|The only way to hide from it is to cover yourself with sulphur from head to toe...|12|7918

0|Yeah, we wonder what...|3|304
0|Well, it seems you ignored my orders, once again, Ÿsel.|8|1526
0|It's true.|3|312
0|Can I ask what are you doing here, then ?|8|1529
0|They must certainly want to buy Ofire's fuel of Dejean, the best in all Luminax !|12|532
0|Yes, we were about to.\nA huge ship is threatening my planet.\nIt is worrying me.|2|200
0|Listen, this ship doesn't seem like much of a danger.\nI am currently working hand in hand with diplomatic department of Luminax Federal Council to set up a friendly contact.|8|1530
0|Yes, so this is why yesterday night another smaller ship, blew up a Vulav village.|2|200
0|Listen, I am sure this is an accident, and you mustn't believe everything the news say, you know ?|8|1528
0|...|2|200
0|I don't want to alarm the people, I just want piece.|8|1527
0|I just want everybody to be satisfied.\nEvery single life matters, who knows, maybe they have a family too ?\nWe can't allow us to be cruel, it's disgraceful.|8|1527

0|Very well, we won't move.|3|306

0|But when she'll realize I betrayed her, she'll hurry to deactivate my armor, wich is connected to Hydroplan military network.\nI won't be able to do anything from then on...|3|304
0|...\n...\n...|2|200
0|What if we do not go ?|2|200
0|But we gotta save people !|1.5|101
0|And what if she is right ?\nI mean, we are not sure of acting in the most ethical way.\nWhat if they were also gifted of consciousness ?|2|200
0|What if there actually was a way to sort out all of this and truely satisfy everyone ?\nIt would be, ethically, the best thing to do than find out this way.|2|200
0|What if we were unquestioningly slaughtering sentient beings since the beginning ?|2|200
0|We do not know.|3|305
0|However, what we do know is that a giant ship is threatening this planet.\nA ship wich revealed itself able of erasing a whole city in a flash.\nDeath most probably awaits us in the skies.|3|304
0|We can also look for a diplomatic solution.\nI am convinced there is always a way to get through without killing anybody.|2|200

0|Good. The present state of the situation is not enough to know which one of you is right.\nBut this is an emergency, and I think we're the only ones able of doing something|4|403
0|We must make a choice. We have one chance out of two of doing good, but also of doing bad.\nBut our will is drived by desire of good.|4|402
0|But it is only luck... We cannot...\nSubmit the lives of thousands to our only intuition...|2|200
0|Sadly, we're the only ones who can do anything about it. It's our responsability to choose. What will happen depends on our choices, we're doomed to take decision.|4|407
0|Well, let's not choose anything !\nConflict solved !|1.5|102
0|Or, third option, you can buy great Ofire fuel !|12|532
0|Not making a choice is a good choice.\nDoobliks, you're right, we have only two solutions and we don't know which one is the right one.|3|308

0|We come down to the most primitive form of choice:\nAct or do nothing, how to decide.|2|200

0|But one day, the young Chloralyan girl disappeared in the lands of Stret, and she wasn't to be seen again.|0|0
0|Her lover, resolute to find her, learned the occult art of Sigma, as it was considered a strange form of magic back then. He looked for her, using his new powers, in vain.|0|0
0|Plagued by sorrow, he used his last resources to grow a gigantic forest where she got lost and, in her honour, scealled himself in a statue representing her.|0|0
0|Another version of the story pretends that the forest was created as a huge engine, absorbing sigma to recreate the lost Chloralyan...|0|0
0|It would explain the presence of the Flesias, this endemic species, lusting for sigma energy.|0|0
0|However, this forest is nowadays visited by the couples, who put pebbles to the base of the statue to bring luck to their love.|0|0

0|What do you mean ?|2|200
0|This is a complex notion...\nWe have a different conception of the self from yours, according to what we know...|102|0
0|Normally, every individual being part of our colony has no name, nor personnal identity, it is just a component part of a greater whole, unlike you who are almost-independant individuals from your colony|102|0

0|But It observed you too, and by itself It understood more easily.\nIt gave itself a name and then got away from me.|102|0
0|It was very upset.\nIt started to plot in its corner.\nI did not understand, so I did nothing to stop It.|102|0
0|But why is it attacking us ?|4|400
0|I do not know.\nI can not figure it out, It is juggling with notions I can not comprehend.\nMaybe you will able to understand It...|102|0
0|The only thing I could do was trying to stop It when I understood he was attacking you.\nHence the presence of this ship where you are.|102|0
0|But it was emitting in the direction of a warship, one of its, doubtless...\nWhy ?|2|200
0|I was emitting a blockage signal in its direction, for he doesn't suppress one of your colonies.Unfortunately, it is only temporary, It always finds a way to block the signal, eventually...|102|0

0|Uuuh...|1.5|100
0|Stret Forest is very studied in sigmology because there is unique anomalies lying here. For example, the Flesia which is exclusively attracted by highly contrated forms of Sigma energy.|2|200
0|Oh yeah, it's the big flower !\nBut flowers are cool !|1.5|102
0|PROGFER !\nTHOSE ARE CARNIVOROUS PLANTS, AND WE ARE A REAL FEAST OF SIGMA !|4|401
0|Oh yeah, it's less cool...|1.5|100
0|[RIING]|0|0
0|Well, well, well.\nI can see you didn't listen to me.|8|1529
0|By Luminox, we didn't miss her...|3|306
0|First, miss Ÿsel, I am compelled to deactivate your armour.\nSecond, you are expunged from the Army of Hydroplan and Frigiak.|8|1530 
0|I know...\nIt's no surprise after all...|3|308
0|Good. Now, for you, I can't stop your nuisance yet. But as soon as this invasion is over, you will all be judged and condemned for your acts.|8|1530
0|Yeah, I hope everyone will be judged and condemned for their acts...|3|304
0|And...\nWhat do we do now that you can't use your armour ?|4|407
0|She said she couldn't stop you from fighting, regarding that your powers are biologic.\nAnd my armour, even unactivated, gives me protection.|3|306
0|So we're simply going on, let's find the emitter.\nWe've gone too far to let her stop us !|3|307
0|But what if we are judged and condemned ?|1.5|100
0|You should worry more about the carnivorous plants, hehehe...|4|408
0|Please, don't spook Progfer out...\nDon't worry, Progfer, even with Tog out we're able to survive.|2|200
0|Good ! The emitter shouldn't be very far, we were close when the signal stopped !\nLet's go !|3|307

0|Oh, the black thing behind me ?\nIt appeared one week ago, we were asked to watch it since...|14|541
0|However, there's absolutely nothing to report, we're bored to death...\nMoreover, entrance is forbidden !|14|542
0|Sometimes we play games to pass the time, but now is nap-time, so we do sleep rotation.|14|543
0|Aaah...\nI'd be so happy to be promoted in the Regal Space Fleet, I would have some action there. Apparently, they're chasing some dangerous criminals...|14|544
0|But I haven't got the rank for that...|14|542
0|An invasion ?\nWhat do you mean ?\nIf there was an invasion I would know !|14|545
0|Well I mean...\nGo in if you want, I'll say I saw nothing...\nI hope something will happen...|14|544

0|Who is it talking about ??|4|403
0|Lunians, I think.\nI mean the Black Moon.|2|200

0|...|104|0

2|*|0|0
2|*|0|0
2|*|0|0
0|THEY EVEN TRIED TO KILL ME.|104|0

0|What ?\nBut the Cygians astronauts came back, didn't they ?|2|200

0|It it's the case, it's quite bad...|4|400
0|Why am I blue and mixed with Doublix ?|1.5|100
0|CEASE !\nMY PAINTINGS DO REPRESENT YOU.\nI AGREE THEY ARE NOT "REALISTIC", BUT...|104|0
0|...THEY MATCH THE REALITY I PERCEIVED !\nTHE ONE THAT COULD HAVE BEEN, BUT IS NO MORE.\nYOU WOULDN'T GET IT...|104|0
0|Indeed, we do not understand.|2|200
0|Let's make it quick, why are we here ? And what are you gonna do to us next ?|3|304
0|...and why is there paintings of us on the walls ?|4|400
0|BECAUSE I...\nI WATCHED YOU, SINCE THE BEGINNING...\nSINCE VEGET ESCAPED FROM HIS VILLAGE...|104|0
0|I THOUGHT HE WAS CURIOUS. I THOUGHT IT WAS CURIOUS HOW HE RESISTED ME WITH SUCH DETERMINATION THOUGH I GOT MY TROOPS DEPLOYED.|104|0
0|I THOUGHT IT WAS CURIOUS HOW PROGFER, NO MATTER HIS FEAR AND HIS COMPLAINTS, FOUGHT BRAVELY ON YOUR SIDE.|104|0
0|Well yes, I wasn't going to let my friends alone !|1.5|100
0|I THOUGHT IT WAS CURIOUS HOW ONE COULD QUESTION HIS BELIEFS, AGAIN AND AGAIN, AS DOUBLIX DID.|104|0
0|I think everyone should do this to get to the path of wisdom.|2|200
0|I THOUGHT IT WAS CURIOUS HOW ONE WHO LOOKS SO STUPID COULD BE SO SMART, LIKE DOOBLIKS.|104|0
0|Yeah well, just put a yetus in front of a keyboard for some years...|3|302
0|AND I THOUGHT IT WAS CURIOUS HOW ONE COULD KEEP TEMPER, VALUES AND RIGHTEOUSNESS DESPITE HARDSHIP, AS TOG DID.|104|0
0|No way !\nShe just wanna do pew-pew boom-zap !|4|403
0|THE THING IS...\nI REALLY ADMIRE YOU.\nYOU ARE ALL MY LIFE, I NEVER SAW SOMETHING LIKE YOU UNTIL NOW.|104|0
0|I ALWAYS LIVED ALONE, BUT NOW, I DO NOT FEEL ALONE ANYMORE.\nYOU ARE HERE NOW.|104|0
0|So, are we all friends now ?|1.5|102
0|WE...\nwe...|104|0
0|Shall I remind you that you put Luminax under siege and killed a few hundreds of people.\nSaying all this won't make us forgive you like magic.|3|304
0|I KNOW.\nBUT WHAT I SAID DOES NOT MEAN I AM YOUR FRIEND.\nIN FACT, IT DOES NOT EVEN MEAN THAT I LIKE YOU.|104|0
0|I HAVE A GREATER SCHEME.\nI MUST TAKE CONTROL, I MUST EXPAND MY WORLD.\nAND YOU WILL WANT TO STOP ME.|104|0
0|I MUST BE THE ALMIGHTY ON THE TOP OF THE MOUTAIN OF SILENCE.|104|0
0|But why ?\nLuminax is already pretty cool !\nWe could all live in peace and all !|1.5|100
0|We could meet during holidays !\nHave a lunch on the shores of Frigiak islands !\nHave a nice walk in a chloralyan forest !|1.5|102
0|Watch the stars at night !\nDiscuss about this and that !\nCelebrate fortunate events !|1.5|102
0|SILENCE\nSILENCE !\nSILENCE !!!|104|0
0|YOUR A NOTHING BUT A PARASITIC VOICE IN MY MIND !\nYOU ARE ALL PARASITIC VOICES !\nAND I ONLY OBEY THE VOICE OF DOUBT !|104|0
0|HOW COULD I TRUST YOU A SINGLE MOMENT ?!\nI HAVE NO INSURANCE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY ME LIKE THE LUNIANS, OR DISAPPOINT ME LIKE THE CYGIANS.|104|0
0|EVERYTHING ENDS IN DISAPPOINTMENT !\nI CAN NOT TRUST YOU !|104|0
0|AND THIS IS WHY I MUST RISE ABOVE, BECOME THE MASTER, BECAUSE TRUST IS ONLY BROUGHT BY CONTROL !|104|0
0|I WILL ONLY TRUST WHAT IS DESIGN OR WHAT I CONTROL. AND IF I NEED FRIENDS, THEN I WILL HAVE THE POWER TO CREATE THEM !|104|0
0|ENOUGH TALK.\nDO ME A FAVOR: FIGHT AND DIE WITH DETERMINATION AND HONOUR !|104|0

2|*|0|0
2|*|0|0
2|*|0|0
0|GOOD...\nI...\nYOU ARE RIGHT.|104|0
0|I STOP.\nALL OF THIS WAS NOT A GOOD CHOICE.\nMAYBE SOME PEOPLE ARE WORTHY OF TRUST...|104|0
0|I WANT TO TRY AND LIVE ON LUMINAX.\nWITH YOU.\nAFTER ALL, I COULD MAKE ME AN APPROPRIATE BODY.|104|0
0|I MIGH EVEN BE ABLE TO MAKE... FRIENDS.|104|0
0|Yes !\nAnd we will do picnics !\nAnd hikes !|1.5|102
0|YES...|104|0
0|As I said earlier, you committed serious crimes, don't think we will just let you into our society like that...|3|304
0|THE ONLY "DEAD" PEOPLE ARE CYGIANS.\nAND...\nTHEIR ELECTRONIC NATURE ALLOWED ME TO COPY COPY THEIR MINDS.|104|0
0|I USED THEM TO UNDERSTAND YOUR SOCIETY.\nAND FOR THE PROPERTY DAMAGE, I AM PLENTY ABLE OF REBUILDING EVERYTHING.|104|0
0|That's a relief, but still, there will be a trial.|3|306
0|But...\nAnd Andr-...|4|407
0|FINALLY, HERE YOU ARE !|16|0
0|Obviously...|3|304
0|Since you constantly went against my ordrers, I came to get you myself...|8|529
0|And what a chance !\nHere I found the initiator of this invasion...|8|526
0|Who you wouldn't have found without our help...|2|200
0|Oh, but you don't have to worry, you will become heroes.\nIt's true, I won't take credit for a work you did.|8|530
0|But...?|1.5|100
0|But you will have to make this events good for my campaign to the siege at the Federal Council of Luminax.\nAnd regarding this invader, he will be judged as the first public enemy.|8|529
0|UNTIL THEN, THANK YOU FOR YOUR COOPERATION...\n...AS UNVOLUNTARY AS IT IS.|104|0
0|From what I know, it seems you did more damage than he did. And looking at what he did, this is a serious accusation.|3|304
0|But Tog, and...|4|407
0|Oh, and I am also thinking about an army general who will obediently be rewarded with medal and honours, and have a well-deserved retirement.|8|547
0|I don't receive no honour from a woman who has none.|3|306
0|Tog...|4|407
0|And less from a murderer.|3|312
0|A murde-\nOh.|2|200
0|I don't know what you're talking about.\nI did absolutely nothing wrong.\nThis is just another excuse to stand with your childish ideological stances, Ÿsel.|8|530
0|Say, Traw, do what a mutation bomb is ?|3|304
0|I ONLY KNOW WHAT THE CYGIANS I COPIED THE MIND KNOW.\nTHE CONCEPT OF MUTATION BOMB IS NOT MENTIONNED ANYWHERE.|104|0
0|And this is no surprise, it's a top-secret project from the Hydroplan government.|3|306
0|So...\nWell yeah, that makes no sense, how could he have used it...|4|403
0|Their is only a very few people authorized to have this informations, maybe less than ten.|3|304
0|I don't think I got it...|1.5|100
0|Right, but I think SHE gets it.|3|304
0|...|8|528
0|Do you have a comment, ma'am President Olga Kronima ?|3|312
0|I didn't mean to kill him...\nI was an accident.\nThis idiot had...|8|529
0|Oh, but I know you didn't want to kill HIM.\nAfter all, this parcel bomb was not meant for him...|3|304
0|You troublemaker.\nBelieve me, you won't win a game like this.|8|529
0|The truth will be exposed.\nWe have enough witnesses and proofs here.|3|313
0|Honestly, I didn't mean to get there... But I will have to.|8|527
0|Do you mean, to kill us...?|1.5|100
0|At first, the mutation bomb was designed to bring chaos on the enemy side. No need for a big intervention, just drop the bomb and let it do the rest.\nHence the name of "bomb".|8|529
0|Be you can't always let things get done by themselves.\nSo I asked to some scientists, expert in the fields of Sigma energy and biology, to create a reversible mutation bomb, allowing the subject to keep consciousness and control over his mind.|8|530
0|Some sort of mutation armour.\nI can't wait to show it to you...|8|548
0|BUT YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR MI-...|3|309
2|*|0|0
2|*|0|0
2|*|0|0
0|...\n...\n...|8|549 
0|Well, uh...\nWe won !|4|406
0|So, we have to put the jelly evil president in jail now ?|1.5|100
0|This is Hydroplan and Frigiak states venture.\nAs a general, Tog will probably know what to do.|2|200
0|...\n...\n...|3|305
0|Tog ?|1.5|100
0|I said I'd avenge Anddr's death.\nAnd here lies his murderer before me.|3|312
0|You can't do this.|2|200
0|OF COURSE I CAN !\nSHE DESERVES IT !\nSHE KILLED HIM, I MUST KILL HER.|3|303
0|No.\nLook at her, how pitiful she looks. She already had what she deserves.|2|200
0|If you take revenge, you will just be as wrong as she.\nYou would be a murderer.\nAnd it will haunt you forever.|2|200
0|You already made her pay.\nWe made her pay, together.\nWe got against her schemes, again and again.|2|200
0|We fought with the honour of Luminaxian soldiers, against her.\nIt is no matter she survived this battle.\nI would even say this is for the best, we don't need any more casualties.|2|200
0|Her acts had consequences.\nAnd now that she has lost, you can't kill her.\nOn one hand, because this is absolutely against the moral, I think...|2|200
0|...And on the other hand, and according to you, because it would go against the honour code of the Luminaxian soldier.\nIt would be acting cowardly to hurt someone weaker, it would be cowardly to no fight on equal terms.|2|200
0|And you are no coward, Tog.\nYou are a protector of the people, even for the meanest individuals.\nOlga is one of them. Let it go, move on.|2|200
0|There will always be strong and weak persons, in every field. It is the duty of the strong to make the weak strong, and to protect him during the process.|2|200
0|Never to kill them.\nAnd this is your job, Tog, you chose it.\nYou are a soldier. If you could spare Traw, you shall spare her too.|2|201
0|...\n...\n...|0|2
0|...\nYes.\nYou're right.|3|306
0|You can't say she's applying this to her brother very often...|4|403
0|You're the most dangerous person I met.|3|302
0|So we can go home !!!\nHey, you're coming with with us, Traw !\nEven if you might go to jail !|1.5|102
0|Yes, by the way, it's been a while since we hear him scream last...|4|403

0|... Mmmmh ...\nLet's see my mails...\nStudents' complaints about madam Terav's lessons, again...|6|551
0|[KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK]|0|0
0|Yes ?|6|550
0|Good afternoon, mister dean.|2|200
0|Ah, Doublix, hello.\nPlease, enter.|6|552
1|Et là le gars il entre woaw incroyable putain|0|0
0|You asked to see me, didn't you ?|6|550
0|Yes, sir, even if it is not urgent.\nI hope I'm not interrupting.|2|200
0|Not at all.\nTell me everything.\nIs this about the recent events and your involvement ?|6|553
0|Yes... Sort of.\nLet's say it gave me a lot to think about.\nI know have way more questions than answers.|2|200
0|My main question is...\n...Is my moral good ?\nI always had pacifistic beliefs... But is it good ?|2|200
0|We were lucky that the majority of our opponents were robots controlled by a superior intelligence,\nwhich fortunately came to its senses.|2|200
0|But what will happen when sentient beings will attack us ?\nWhat will happen if these beings are determined to kill us ?\nAnd what if our enemy didn't abandon right on the edge ?|2|200
0|Will this pacifistic approach always be working ?\nAnd even if it is working, how many casualties will it take for our enemies to realise their acts ?|2|200
0|These are intersting questions, Doublix.\nAnd it's no surprise you're asking them.|6|554
0|Do you have an answer, or at least a track, sir ?|2|200
0|I'm afraid not, not really.\nDespite my old age, I never thought about these questions.\nIt's been a very long time since anybody needed to ask these...|6|551
0|Peace is a good thing, at least when you keep an idea of what the danger is. Without getting paranoid, of course. Just nurturing a little "and if..."|6|550
0|Do you know Tog ?\nDoobliks's sister ?|2|200
0|You four told me about her sometimes, yes.\nYou helped her fight the threat upon us, didn't you ?|6|552
0|Exact.\nShe is quite nice, but stubborn in her beliefs and warrior values.\nI don't really agree with her, but...|2|200
0|...But without her and her values, we would probably be dead.|2|200
0|Yes, to be honest Doobliks and Progfer told me everything.\nSurprisingly, they mostly talked about you, your doubts and your discussion with Tog.|6|550
0|So you knew that I would come to you ?\nWhy didn't you tell me from the beginning ?|2|200
0|To keep my old Chloralyan mysterious aura.\nBut that's not the question.|6|552
0|...|2|200
0|Imagine for a moment how would have been your adventure without one of the five of you.|6|554
0|I think...\nIt would have be catastrophic...|2|200
0|Maybe.\nWhat is sure is that you complete each other.\nYou make a great team, and you wouldn't get anywhere alone.|6|550
0|Tog has a strong will and ardour to assert her conception of the good, which is very honourable of course.|6|550
0|But no one can be sure of what conception of the good is the right one, and that's her problem.\nThis time, it ended well. But what if you weren't with her ?|6|554
0|Moreover, no one can tell the consequences of your actions that are to come, neither the consequences if you made different choices.|6|553
0|It's important to defend your convictions, whatever they are, but you mustn't ever forget that they may wrong and could be changed.|6|552
0|If you don't defend them, you only watch the world doing it for you. But if you never question them and never accept that you could be wrong, you just get fanatic.|6|551
0|Tog is way too stubborn, whereas you think way too much.\nThe moral of this story is not that Tog, or the military dogma, is right. Only a fool could think that.|6|551
0|I think I understand where you're going....|2|200
0|You're all still so young.\nIf you keep this close, you will grow learning from each other. By supporting each other, you will give yourselves what you lack individually.|6|552
0|But you will have to keep helping each other.\nOne can't just face such complex situations and dilemmas by oneself.|6|551
0|Even though one may be open-minded and cultured.\nHere's the solution to your questions, Doublix.\nYou must seek it by considering other ways of thinking.|6|552
0|Observe, forge your own philosophy, your own moral sense, your own way of viewing the world.\nDon't ever fall in dogma, yours or another's. Make your own path, and keep an eye on those beside yours.|6|550
0|I now see more clearly.\nThank you a lot, sir.|2|200
0|You're welcome !\nMy PhD in physical optics is made for that...|6|552
0|Wait... Not really...\n...\nWhat rubbish am I talking again ?|6|551

0|THE DOTS BETWEEN TWO SYMBOLS INDICATE THE CONTRARY !\nYOU KNOW ON WHICH SIDE THEY ARE FROM THE OTHER, BUT YOU DO NOT KNOW THE DISTANCE IN BETWEEN !|0|0

0|Here's your fantomis, dear progamer who completes the games at 100%.\nComment ? This is a plant fantomis ? Is that what you want me to tell you ?\nWRONG !|0|0
0|It is a fantomis of irony.\nYes, it's inconsistent with the background, but you're not supposed to know the existence of fantomis either at this point of the game.|0|0
0|Either you saw a tip on Internet (if my game becomes popular enough to have tips on Internet...), or you're dumb enough to open the same dialog box 10 times, or you just restarted the game.|0|0
0|Look, it's a fantomis of irony, look I'm so ironic and subversive that I break the fourth wall like all those indie games.\nLook at this fantomis I drew one night on GIMP. LOOK AT IT.|0|0
0|IT'S A FUCKING 16x16p TREE DRAWN IN GIMP IN NO MORE THAN 2 MINUTES.\nDO YOU FEEL THE IRONY OR DO YOU NOT FUCKING FEEL IT ?\nFOR FUCK'S SAKE, LOOK AT IT, LOOK AT IT PROPERLY.|0|0
0|BUDDY, IT REPRESENTS THE ***IRONY***, LOOK.\nLIKE, IT'S JUST PURE IRONY.\nYOU CAN'T DO SHIT AGAINST THAT, DO YOU FUCKING UNDERSTAND NOW ???|0|0
0|DID YOU THINK I WAS TOBY FOX DOING FANTOMIS OF "determination" OR OF "bravery" OR BULLSHIT LIKE THAT ?\nNO BUD, I FUCKING DO FANTOMIS OF IRONY, AND FUCK YOU.|0|0
0|No, for real, I just needed to relax a bit, but I'm okay.\nI like doing this game, but still I can't wait to finish it...\nThis battle is going on for too long now.|0|0
0|Here, have +10 maximum Sigma energy and carry on, I hope you like the game. It's a real pleasure that someone plays it anyway ! Thank you a lot, dear progamer who completes the games at 100% !|0|0

1|Bon et hop, West de fait.|0|0
0|Welcome my dear Veget, you're in the Ozer dimension !\nIt's been a while since I last saw you here !\nGood, let's get to the point. (press E for continue)|0|0
0|My name is Hex, I am an omniscient entity controlling this dimension.\nToday, I'm gonna teach you some things so you won't be lost during your oncoming adventure...|0|0
0|I know, you and your friends will face many issues and it won't be always easy...\nBut I can't tell you more about it.|0|0
0|First of all, I hope you went in the settings menu to change your keys !\nIf you didn't, I encourage you to, also it will make you aware of what you can do.|0|0
0|And I won't have to tell you which keys to press...|0|0
0|When you're done, go and walk on the blue square I'll reveal !|0|0
1|THE RIDE NEVER ENDS AAAAAH|0|0
0|GOOOOD !!!\nYou know how to WALK !!!\nIT'S INCREDIBLE, IT'S HIM ! HE DID IT !|0|0
0|Erm...\nSorry, I lost it a bit...\nLet's continue.|0|0
0|As you may know, you've got Sigma energy inside of you.\nEvery single inhabitant of Luminax contains a bit of this energy, but you've got A LOT.|0|0
0|Indeed, remember, you and some of your friends injected some in your bodies for a study experiment...\nStudents are weird, but anyway.|0|0
0|Thanks to a great amount of energy, you can throw attacks at your enemies !\nAnd that makes you living weapons ! Which is, uh... Quite dangerous, actually ?|0|0
0|Anyway.\nYour first attack is simple. You throw concentrated sigma balls.|0|0
0|The second one is quite simple too, you heal yourself and your allies from injuries you received|0|0
0|The third one is kind of a mix of the two first, you pump to life of your enemies, they take damage and you heal your buddies !\n(It looks a bit cruel though...)|0|0
0|The last one consists in thorns you grow on a straight line in front of you, and they hurt a lot !\nThat's useful to make a defense line against several enemies.|0|0
0|Good, now I'm gonna materialize a bad robot so you can put all this teaching in practice.|0|0
1|Erh...|0|0
0|Perfect. As you could see, it exploded in many sigma bits that you were able to get to reload your sigma.\nIt can happen to you too if you're not careful enough...|0|0
0|By the way, your life gauge, as for your sigma gauge, is shared with your friends'.\nThey all have different attacks.|0|0
0|You'll find out later, but here are some examples. Your friend Progfer can take the hits with his shell and send them back by throwing it.|0|0
0|Your friends Doublix and Doobliks can stack a lot of steam to make heavy damage, it's very useful against opponents who don't always show their weak spots !|0|0
0|And your friend Tog has got landmines, they're very useful against hoards of enemies.|0|0
0|One last thing, I strongly advise you to listen to the people around you. That's useful if you wanna know what to do. And it's rude to let people talk in a vacuum !|0|0
0|By the way, sometimes you'll face choices. These are indicated by a blue arrow and a purple arrow, but you won't have any struggle if you read everything properly.|0|0
0|Oh, and uh, the yellow arrows are just here to show you where to go.|0|0
0|Good ! I think that's it !\nYou will now wake up in your bed, barely remembering a thing of what I said, thinking it was just a dream.|0|0
0|I wish you good luck ! You'll need it...|0|0
