0|Check this engine !\nI want it !|4|406
0|Perfect Veget !\nGo on like this !|3|300
0|NO NO NO I'M SCAAAAARED!\nWHY DID I DO THAT ?|1.5|101
0|Good.\nThis is pleasing.|2|200
0|I'm getting nervous...|1.5|100
0|Veget! We're counting on you !\nHurry, we're in trouble !|3|304
0|Well... We must have enough Sigma left to blast'em out !|4|404
0|Sigma level low.|2|200
0|Thanks Veget!!!|1.5|102
0|Excellent, let's keep on taking their Sigma.|3|307
0|The mothership seems to send signals to 4 entities it materialised...\nIf we destroy them all, then maybe...|3|304
0|So here's one of those famous entities. We must eliminate them quick.|3|304
0|Onedoneonedoneonedone...\nSTILL THREE LEFT!!!!|1.5|101
0|Hahaha, go back in hell, son of Halkor!|4|404
0|Entity eliminated. One left. We're getting to it.|2|200
0|The machines are self-destructing ! We made it !!\nWe may return to the elevator to get into the bunker.\nYet again, congrats !|3|300
#BOSS 1
0|AAAAAAAAAH ! WHAT'S THAT THING ?! I WANNA SEE AUNTIE AMETHYA !|1.5|101
0|ANDDR !! OH NO ! CAN IT BE ?|3|309
0|One...One of these famous...|4|402
0|Uh... We heard a noise and there are rocks blocking the way. Are you doing all right general ?|5|521
0|NO ! GENERAL ANDDR MUTATED ! COME AND HELP US, IT'S AN ORDER !|3|303
0|No offense, general, but we have under ten soldiers left...|5|516
0|ANY CASUALTIES  ??|1.5|101
0|Uuh... Not really, the others just listened to Olga's orders and have... Left.|5|517
0|ARE YOU KIDDING ?!|3|303
0|I would have loved to... How can we help ?|5|520
0|Don't you have guns to blast the rocks and get to us ?|2|200
0|N-no... Neutralizing guns only, to be fair... Lethal ones are for generals...|5|516
0|Lethal ones can't break a rock.|3|304
0|Y-yes... To do that, we need a special unit... Which is not here... And the president won't even grant one to us...|5|521
0|Soldiers, stand where you are and try finding a way to get in. The five of us will deal with Andrr.|3|304
0|His body seems invulnerable, but some...thing is getting out of him periodically, and is actually vulnerable... Wich confirms... Our theory...|4|407
0|It couldn't be otherwise. We must imperatively kill this thing.|3|304
0|The rest of the time, it concentrates a great quantity of Sigma energy on the floor. What is the nature of the thing you're speaking of ?|2|200
0|We didn't study it at Gentilis... Because it has nothing to do with Sigma...|4|407
0|But what is it ? I don't get it !|1.5|101
0|Something terrifying known by few people... But we'll explain it later... Focus on the goal.|3|304
0|Yes sir !|1.5|102
0|AAAAAAAAAH ! BUT WHAT'S THIS THING ?! I WANNA SEE AUNTIE AMETHYA !|1.5|101
0|Not to scare you Progfer, this... is way much terrifying than you think...|4|400
0|Uh... We heard a noise and there are rocks blocking the way. Are you doing all right general ?|5|521
0|THE GENERAL IS NOT HERE ANYMORE !! HE'S BEEN EATEN BY THE MONSTER !! Where is Tog...|1.5|101
0|Well you're half right...I will...Tell you if we get through it alive...|4|407
0|Doobliks, what are you talking about ?|2|200
0|pretendtounderstandorelseprogferwillfreakout.|4|403
0|I didn't hear, could you speak louder ?|2|200
0|Are you alright in there ?|5|516
0|AAAARGH ! SHUT UT, ALL OF YOU !|4|401
0|Very well.|2|200
0|But, Doobliks, please don't get mad ! But I'm really really scared !|1.5|100
0|Veget, you're the only one who understands me, as always. The goal here is to BEAT THE FRICK out of the periodically-appearing-thingy. Yeah, we'll do this.|4|403
0|So... You alright ?|5|521
0|OH CALL TOG INSTEAD !|4|401
0|Uh, oh... Yes.|5|516
0|Since immemorial times, located in a lost and unknown place, shines a faraway star...|-1|0
0|Luminax. Eight planets, all different, spinning around it.|-1|0
0|Eons ago, a highly advanced specie settled on the most habitable ones. It thrived by adapting and so dividing into five different species.|-1|0
0|A History full of wars, totalitarianism, but also technological progress and hope, finally gave birth to a peaceful world of knowledge.|-1|0
0|Since year 8000, planet Cygio leads a space program in direction of the farthest planet  of the system, the so-called Black Moon.|-1|0
0|Year 8068, Spitoff, Verity, and Nehman, three Cygian astronauts , left to another expedition.The take-off and the landing went well. They had successfully collected the ressources they were asked for, and seamlessly got home, hailed by entire Luminax...|-1|0
0|...Or, at least, we thought so...|-1|0
0|Many Frigiak inhabitants found refuge underground.\n A place we'll later name the Bunker 03.|3|0
0|You're scientists, guys.\nYou know Luminaxian genome better than me, whatsoever, it's higly malleable.|3|0
0|These Hydroplanians obviously knew it.\n And so they got an idea.|3|0
0|Modify their's to transform into Vulavians, and thus not being persecuted by Halkorian milice.\nA good idea on paper...|3|0
0|...But it didn't went as planned.|3|0
0|First to try became abominations.\nSomething so awful that the survivors prefered to sceal the place and live on the surface, risking to get caught.|3|0
0|After Halkor's fall, year 1, the new Hydroplan government discovered their work.\nThey managed to keep it a secret.|3|0
0|...And decided to make this breakthrough a last option weapon.\nIt's known as the Mutating Bomb.\nThe way to use your ennemy to destroy himself.|3|0
0|Too bad this invasion happens during hollidays, I would have loved to invite you all to my place. It's good to see each other from time to time !|1.5|100
0|Well Progfer, we're precisely going to see each other a lot, even if the circumstances aren't optimum.|2|200
0|Oh yes  ! That is true !|1.5|101
0|Good, the ship is on the other side of the planet.\nVeget, just take care of navigation, I'll go with defense maneuvers.|3|307
0|And huuum...\What do we do ?\n I wanna help please !|1.5|100
0|If you insist, you can get off my foot,\nBECAUSE I'M CURRENTLY SUFFERING !|4|401
0|SORRY DOUBLIKS !!!|1.5|101
0|I apologize Progfer, but the ship commands were initially made for two people maximum !\nI'll get you something to do once the bad guy is defeated, okay ?|3|311
0|Oh cool !|1.5|102
0|I have an idea about how I'll help !|4|406
0|Oh is that so ? Can I assist you ?|1.5|102
0|Yes ! I'm going to...|4|406
0|HIT MY SISTER !!|4|404
0|[SLAP]|0|0
0|OH NO THAT'S NOT KIND !!!|1.5|101
0|ARE YOU COMPLETELY STUPID AND MAD ?!|3|303
0|NYEHEHHEHEHEHHEHEHEH|4|404
0|AND THAT HURTS !\nTHE SECOND WE'RE ON FIRM GROUND I'LL KILL YOU REAL HARD !!!|3|303
0|MUAHAHAHAHAHA !\n JUST TRY !!|4|404
0|I'm worried about the outcome of this mission...|2|200
0|There it is, it's big, but it must have its weaknesses...|3|304
0|Look at the pile of guns up there, if we try to eliminate that first, maybe it won't be able to attack anymore...|2|200
0|Good idea !\nVeget, head for that spot so I can shoot it !|3|307
0|It doesn't look so dead after all...|1.5|100
0|Look, the head is opening!\nThere's something inside, like a weapon !|4|402
0|It's true, let's figure out wether it's vulnerable or not...|3|307
0|WE DID IT !!\nIT'S FINALLY DESTROYED !!\nCONGRATS EVERYONE !|3|300
0|YEAH, IT'S US !\nWE DID IT !\nIT'S US !|4|405
0|Yeah well, I didn't do much and neither do you.|2|200
0|Say um...|1.5|100
0|Yes ?|3|300
0|The screen displayed a signal during the whole battle,\nand I know it !!|1.5|102
0|A signal you know ? What do you mean ?|2|200
0|At this time of the year, Chlorozol is very near to Stalor, so I like to watch the forests from my telescope !|1.5|102
0|And as you know, my telescope has a very precise radar. And recently I got this very strange signal while I was watching at one of these forests !|1.5|100
0|Go on ?|4|400
0|No, that's all. Don't you think it's a funny coincidence ?|1.5|102
0|And today, this signal was correlated with the presence of enemies ships ?|3|300
0|Duh yeah.|1.5|100
0|PROGFER ! YOU MAY HAVE FOUND THE SOLUTION !!|3|300
0|Oh uh really ?!|1.5|102
0|It would be plausible...\nWould it be that he found this invasion origin ?|2|200
0|Or an emitter relay ?\nWhatever, we're closer to our goal than ever !|4|402
0|Oh does this mean I helped you ?|1.5|102
0|Yes !\nWithout knowing, what you did helped us a lot !\nCongrats Progfer !|3|300
0|WOOW !\nTOO MANY COMPLIMENTS, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO ANSWER !!!|1.5|101
0|Good, let's get to the origin of the signal !|3|307
0|Not if I have my word to say.|8|1529
0|Oh no... \nNot this moron...|4|403
0|As the president of United Nations of Hydroplan and Frigiak, I put you under arrest.\nSurrender, or we will make you comply by force.|8|1529
0|WE WON'T EVER SURRENDER !\nTHIS IS ABOUT THE SAKE OF WHOLE LUMINAX !|3|303
0|After all uuuh...\nShe looks a bit more powerful... No ?|1.5|100
0|YEAH WE WILL BEAT YOU UP !|4|401
0|I will just incapacitate you and put you in jail.\nI am not planning on killing you.\nYou should surrender.|8|1526
0|Oh !\nIt's okay then !|1.5|102
0|No it's not okay.\nWe're the only one acting against this invasion.\nIf we stop there, Luminax may fall.|3|304
0|PRESIDENT TO THE GROUND !\nOLGA KRONIMA RESIGNATION !\nYEAAAAH !!!|4|404
0|Listen, there are different ways of acting, and I go the right way.\nI sent some  reconnaissance to Cygio, they didn't come back yet.|8|1530
0|And currently, as I said, we are discussing a plan to handle this situation with the Federation Council of Luminax.\nWe're acting, and we're acting good.|8|1530
0|THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING !\nYOU'RE DOING NOTHING !\nNOTHING BUT CHATTING ON GENTILIS MEANWHILE PEOPLE GET KILLED !|3|303
0|EXCEPT US, I SAW NOBODY DOING ANYTHING SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS CRISIS !\nWHERE DID THE BRAVE LUMINAXIAN SOLDIERS GO ?|3|303
0|WHERE IS BRAVERY, HONESTY, AND DUTY TO THE PEOPLE ?|3|303
0|Those are barbarian values of another time.\nI don't kill anybody.|8|1528 
0|But you let people getting killed.|3|312
0|Enough.\nWe argued about this too many times together.\nCapture them.|8|1529
0|Erh, well, hey nothing personal !|5|516
0|Tog, we can't attack them, they're not responsible. They don't deserve the risk of being killed !|2|200
0|You're right, I know.\nWe can't attack them anyway.|3|306
0|Why ?|2|200
0|Duh, we have constant shield...\nUnlike your old rusty ship...|5|520
0|We promise we'll try no to hurt you !\nBut I don't wanna lose my job...|5|516
0|So, what do we do ?|4|407
0|We hold out.\nWe follow the signal.\nWe try to go for Chlorozol and land.|3|304
0|Gulp...|1.5|100
0|If we can't destroy the bad ship, where are we going ?|1.5|100
0|To Cygio, this is the only planet we didn't hear from since the beginning of this crisis.|3|301
0|Besides, there is still no attack from the enemy ship, it's a good sign.|2|200
0|Yes, let's hope it goes on like this...|3|311
0|Oh, look at control panel screen !|1.5|102
0|Yes, we can see the enemy spaceship, and it's doing nothing.|4|400
0|Yeah, but the signal it gets is very familiar to me, that's fun !|1.5|102
0|A signal ? Very familiar ? What do you mean ?|2|200
0|At this time of the year, Chlorozol is close from Stalor, so I like to watch the forests with my telescope !|1.5|102
0|And as you know, my telescope has a high precision radar, and recently I intercepted this strange signal while watching one of the forests !|1.5|100
0|Go on ?|4|400
0|No that's all. Isn't it a funny coincidence ?|1.5|102
0|So, on the screen, this ship presence is correlated with the signal ?|3|300
0|If my calculation is right, yes.|1.5|100
0|PROGFER ! YOU PROBABLY SORT OUT THE PROBLEM !!|3|300
0|Oh eh you think ?!|1.5|102
0|It's a possibility ...\nWould he have found the origin of this invasion ?\nWere we mistaken by rushing to Cygio ?|2|200
0|It may be a relay emitter ?\nAnyway, we're closer to our goal !|4|402
0|Oh, does that mean I helped you ?|1.5|102
0|Yes !\nYou may didn't know it, but what you did helped a lot !\nCongrats Progfer !|3|300
0|AAAH !\nTOO MANY COMPLIMENTS, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO RESPOND !!!|1.5|101
0|Good, let's immediatly go to the origin of this signal !|3|307
0|HAAAAAALT !!!|15|0
0|What's happening ?|5|516
0|We heard a rumour about HIGHLY DANGEROUS CRIMINALS reaching to the planetary spatial territory of the Kingdom of Chlorozol.|13|534
0|In the name of the King, and of Luminax, and of the MIGHTY King's Space Fleet, Bilder class, you are UNDER ARREST !!|13|535
0|Oh, well here are the dangerous criminals, guys.\nIf you want them this bad, you can have them.|5|516
0|Hey, we don't have jurisdiction upon "planetary spatial territory of Chlorozol" anymay ?|5|515
0|Nah, nah we don't have jurisdiction upon Chlorozol space things, for sure.\nWe don't wanna have diplomatic problems.|5|519
0|Good luck, DANGEROUS CRIMINALS !|5|514
0|See ya !|5|519
0|OH NO !\nWE'RE GONNA BE ARRESTED BY CHLOROZOL KING'S GUARDS !|1.5|101
0|Hum no...\nActually we are the MIGH-...|13|536
0|Calm down Progfer, Chlorozol army is famous in the whole stellar system for its inefficiency...|3|302
0|...-Bilder cla-\nHEY !|13|535
0|In the worst case, we're going to die from boredom.|4|408
0|...|0|3
0|Oops...\nSorry Veget...|4|402
0|...but you know there's some truth to it...|4|400
0|STOP MOCKING US !\nWe are going to CAPTURE you this instant, and you will be judged for you CRIMES by CHLOROZOL KING'S COURT !!!|13|535
0|I didn't quite get what they did; could you repeat ?|14|539
0|Uuuh...\nDISRUPTION OF PUBLIC ORDER !|13|534
0|Oh yeah, that's something...|14|540
0|Please hurry, let's finish this...|3|302
0|IN THE NAME OF SAUGUS, KING OF CHLOROZOL, AND IN THE NAME OF LUMINAX FEDERATION, YOU ARE UNDER AR-...|13|537
0|Captain, I think they're leaving...|14|539
0|NOOO !\nYOU CAN'T JUST LEAVE WHEN YOU ARE PUT UNDER ARREST IN THE NAME OF THE KI...|13|538
0|haha,\nship's engine goes\nbrrrrrr|4|406
0|...But, are you sure that...|1.5|100
0|Yes.|2|200
0|Well.\nLet's not freak out, there must be a way to get out, or to destroy this terrible machine.|3|304
0|AAAAAAAAH !!!\nIT'S MOVING EVERYWHERE !!!\nI WANNA GET INSIDE MY SHELL !!!|1.5|101
0|...|3|305
0|Are you kidding ?\nIt's TERRIFIC !|4|404
0|We should maybe rescue the Cygians in the flying cages.|2|200
0|AHAHAHA !\nLOOK AT YOU, STUPID WORMS, YOU ARE ALREADY WIGGLING EVERYWHERE AS IS JUST STARTS !!|104|0
0|By Luminox, someone make it shut its mouth, or something...|3|306
0|Whe should destroy the machine before breaking them free, don't we ?|4|400
0|EVEN IF YOU SUCCEED, THOSE IN THE CAGES WILL BE SHOCKED TO DEATH !|104|0
0|So we must free them before...\nIt makes this sick game way harder, but not impossible...|3|307
0|One free !\nI wanna go in one of those, seems funny...|4|406
0|I don't think now is the appropriate moment...|2|200
0|That's two !|3|300
0|WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS USELESS, YOU KNOW IT, RIGHT ?\nMY MACHINE WILL KILL YOU ANYWAY.|104|0
0|Good, only one more to go, then we can escape.|2|200
0|NO, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO, HAHAHA.|104|0
0|THEY'RE ALL FREE !!!\nHOORAY !!!|1.5|101
0|NOT HALF !\nYOU STILL HAVE TO ESCAPE FROM MY DEATH MACHINE, WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE !!!|104|0
0|Oooh...|1.5|100
0|Don't listen to him, Progfer, we're gonna kick its ass, you'll see !|3|307
0|IT SEEMS TO BE A HABIT WITH YOU, FIGHTING FOR LOST CAUSES !|104|0
0|I AM AT THE TOP OF MY ALL-POWERFULNESS, GIVE UP, JUST LIKE YOU DID BEFORE.|104|0
0|I AM GOING TO ENSLAVE LUMINAX.\nTHIS IS MY WILL !|104|0
0|I AM GOING TO MAKE YOU PAY FOR ALL YOUR MISDEEDS.|104|0
0|FOR I AM RISEN AS GOD TO THIS WORLD !|104|0
0|THERE ARE MANY THINGS YOU CAN NOT COMPREHEND.\nTHERE ARE THINGS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOUR LIVES AT STAKE.|104|0
0|MY POWER DOES NOT COME FROM THE VOID, I CAN TELL YOU NOW THAT YOUR DEATH IS NEAR.|104|0
0|I MADE A PACT.\nA PACT WITH A VERY, VERY POWERFUL ENTITY.|104|0
0|THIS IS THE WHITE CROSS.|104|0
0|THE WHITE CROSS OFFERS ME THIS WORLD IN EXCHANGE FOR SOME SACRIFICES.|104|0
0|DO I LOOK LIKE I AM SUFFERING ?\nNONSENSE !\nI TAKE IT ALL, PERFECTLY !|104|0
0|I CAN DO THIS ALL DAY !\nCAN YOU ?|104|0
0|I WILL DO EVERYTHING TO GET TO MY FINAL GOAL !|104|0
0|FOR I AM THE KING ON THE TOP OF THE MOUTAIN !!!\nAND YOU ARE NOTHING !|104|0
0|PERISH BY MY STRIKES !!|104|0
0|YOU ARE NOT...\nEVEN AWARE...\nOF WHAT EXISTS OUTSIDE OF...THE BORDERS...OF THE KNOWN UNIVERSE.|104|0
0|I...I SAW WHAT WAS...OUTSIDE.|104|0
0|THE WHITE CROSS MADE ME GLIMPSE...REALITY...|104|0
